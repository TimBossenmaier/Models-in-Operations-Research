[**Cutting Stock**](CuttingStock)

A model that provides a minimum number of shelves and shelf occupancy for a given quantity of products in supermarkets. by using a [cutting stock problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem). The cutting stock problem is implemented via [column generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column_generation).

[**Sudoku**](Sudoku)

Solves any as input given sudoku riddle using [constraint programming](https://developer.ibm.com/docloud/documentation/optimization-modeling/cp/).
<br />
<br />

[**SurgerySchedule**](SurgerySchedule)

Creates a schedule of optional and emergency surgeries for a operating room using again constrain programming.
<br />
<br />

[**Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)**](TSP)

Solves any given [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) by using a [cutting-plane method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting-plane_method).
<br />
<br />

[**Travelling Salesman Problem with CP**](TSP_CP)

Solves any given [TSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) by using a constraint programming.
